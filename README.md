ðŸ“„ Task 3 Description â€“ Lexical Analyzer (Compiler Design Basics)

This project is developed as part of Task 3 assigned by CodTech IT Solutions for the C language internship program. The aim of this task is to build a simple Lexical Analyzer using the C programming language. A lexical analyzer, also known as a scanner or tokenizer, is the first phase of a compiler, responsible for reading the source code and breaking it down into meaningful components known as tokens. These tokens can be keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, or punctuation marks. This task helps students understand how compilers begin the process of converting human-readable code into machine code by performing lexical analysis.

In this project, a C program is created that reads from a text file named input.txt, which contains sample code written in the C language. The program then scans each character and forms tokens based on a set of rules. It classifies these tokens into categories such as keywords (e.g., int, if, while), identifiers (e.g., variable names like a, sum), and operators (e.g., +, =, >). The program is also capable of distinguishing between numbers and special characters. A predefined list of C language keywords is stored, and the program checks whether a scanned word matches any of those keywords. If it does, it's categorized as a keyword; otherwise, it is treated as an identifier.

The code is modular and structured for easy understanding. It uses standard input/output functions, file handling, and character checking using functions like isalpha(), isdigit(), and isalnum() from the C standard library. The output is displayed in the terminal, showing each token and its classification. This provides a clear understanding of how lexical analyzers work in real-world compilers. The user simply needs to create an input.txt file with sample C code and run the program to see the tokens generated from the source.

This task enhances a student's ability to work with file I/O, strings, loops, and conditional logic in C. More importantly, it introduces the fundamental concept of how source code is parsed in compiler design. The implementation focuses on simplicity and clarity, making it suitable for beginners who are new to compiler construction or lexical analysis. Through this task, the student gains insight into how programming languages are interpreted and lays the groundwork for further learning in areas such as syntax analysis and code generation. The program not only fulfills the internship requirements but also adds valuable practical knowledge to the student's programming and theoretical skill set. Overall, Task 3 reinforces core C concepts and bridges them with foundational topics in computer science like compilers and interpreters, making it a vital and educationally rich part of the internship experience.
